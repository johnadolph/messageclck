# messageclck
Arduino based message clock using LCD TFT Display a Message clock that can be programmed to show messages at specific days and times.
It also has an RGB LED and a Speaker to play tones and light up to make the Message more entertaining.
Before you get started on the build, you will need the following parts:

Obviously, you will need a Computer with the Arduino IDE installed and a USB Cable to connect your Arduino to your PC..

Note: the links to the parts are not necessarily the same parts I used, because I used the parts I had available on hand and purchased a while back..

Arduino Uno R3 or compatible 

Sainsmart "1.8" TFT Color LCD Display

A TinyRTC Module you will also need 2.54 single row pins to solder on to the RTC module, because most RTC modules do not come with pins soldered to the PCB.

An RGB LED Module (OPTIONAL , IF YOU WANT A LIGHT SHOW) 

A speaker or piezo buzzer (OPTIONAL , IF YOU WANT SOUND)

Mini Breadboard  (with prototype shield, protoshield is optional but recommended)

Breadboard Jumper Wires

You will also need to install these libraries into the Arduino IDE:

The Wire Library

The SPI Library

The RTC Library

Adafruit ST7735 library

Adafruit GFX Library
